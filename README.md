# Decentralized Single-Page Apps (DApps) Repository

This repository is a collection of decentralized applications built entirely within a single HTML page. The intent of this repo is to curate permissionless DApps that are just a click away even for non-tech users - no installations, no dependencies, just simple single-page HTML.

## üåü Features

- **Single-HTML-Page Design:** Each DApp in this repository is self-contained within a single HTML file, promoting simplicity and ease of use.
- **Open Source Collaboration:** All DApps are open source, inviting contributions, enhancements, and innovations from developer community.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore the DApps in this repository, simply clone the repository and open the HTML file (index.html) from any folder in your browser to use it.

## üìú List of DApps

- **DApp Name:** Brief description of the DApp and any special instructions for use.
- **[Eth Balance Checker](Dapps/EthBalanceChecker/index.html):** This web-based application allows you to upload a CSV file containing Ethereum addresses (in a column named "address") to retrieve and display their ETH balances in both ETH and USD. The current ETH price is fetched from CoinGecko, and the results are provided in a downloadable CSV file. The app efficiently processes multiple addresses and handles invalid ones without interrupting the operation.
